Django Twitter
===================================================================

Django Twitter is designed to make it easy to collect and store data from Twitter in a database, using Django.
It is layered on top of Pewhooks - our collection of Python utilities for interfacing with various APIs, including
Twitter - and provides a set of standardized abstract Django models and Django commands for querying the Twitter
API and storing the data you get back.
